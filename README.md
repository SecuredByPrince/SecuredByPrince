# 👋 Welcome to **SecuredByPrince**

## 🛡️ Identity-First Cloud & AI Security for Startups

Hi, I’m **Prince Richard Osaro** — a **Cloud Security Engineer (Early Career)** focused on helping **startups and growing teams design, deploy, and secure Azure and Microsoft 365 environments** using an **identity-first (Zero Trust) approach**, practical IAM controls, and lightweight governance foundations.

Many teams only discover security gaps during **audits, investor due diligence, or after incidents**. I help teams **reduce risk early** by implementing **real security controls that improve security posture** — not paperwork-heavy compliance.

---

## 🔍 What I Work On (Hands-On)

- **Azure & Microsoft 365 security gap reviews** (hardening + misconfigurations)
- **Identity & access risk reduction** (Entra ID, MFA, RBAC, least privilege)
- **Security visibility** (logging, monitoring, alerting baselines)
- Mapping cloud controls to **ISO/IEC 27001 intent**
- Supporting early **AI governance foundations aligned with ISO/IEC 42001**

## 🧠 My Approach

I follow a **risk-first, startup-friendly security mindset**:

✅ **Secure identity first** (access control & governance)  
✅ **Improve visibility early** (logging + monitoring)  
✅ **Build audit-ready controls lightly** (practical, scalable foundations)

I’m open to **mentorship, collaboration, and learning opportunities**, while delivering **real value** by helping teams strengthen security **without the cost of a full-time security hire**.
