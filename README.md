# 👋 Welcome to **SecuredByPrince**

## 🛡️ Identity-First Cloud & AI Security for Startups

Hi, I’m **Prince Richard Osaro** — an **early-career Cloud Security Engineer** focused on helping **startups and growing teams design, deploy, and secure Azure cloud environments** using **identity-first security, practical IAM, and lightweight governance controls**.

Many teams only discover security gaps during **audits, investor due diligence, or after incidents**. My focus is on **early risk identification and practical security controls**, not paperwork-heavy compliance.

## 🔍 What I Work On (Hands-On)

* Azure & Microsoft 365 security gap reviews
* Identity & access risk reduction (Entra ID, MFA, RBAC)
* Cloud logging, monitoring, and security visibility
* Mapping Azure controls to **ISO/IEC 27001 intent**
* Laying early **AI governance foundations aligned with ISO/IEC 42001**

## 🧠 My Approach

I take a **risk-first, startup-friendly approach** to cloud security.
I’m open to **mentorship, collaboration, and learning opportunities**, while delivering **real, practical value** by helping teams improve their security posture **without the cost of a full-time security hire**.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

I’m currently developing **hands-on projects** around:

* Cloud IAM hygiene
* Secure Azure landing zones
* Logging and monitoring baselines
* ISO/IEC 27001 & ISO/IEC 42001–aligned starter controls

These projects are designed to help founders and small teams implement **secure, audit-ready, and operationally reliable cloud environments from day one**.
